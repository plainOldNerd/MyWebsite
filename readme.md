#My Website

I decided to create a website mainly for these two reasons:

1. Have a link to it on my resume, and links from it to LinkedIn, StackOverflow, and GitHub
2. Teach myself React.

This website was not built with extensibility or maintainability in mind (I built it as a static website with no server, which automatically limits the extensibility of it) but have made as extensible as possible. Due to the inherent interdependancies between the React components' CSS and native CSS of the page, some of which are different between PC and mobile versions and some of which are universal, maintainability has suffered a little here. This is not a huge concern as this is a static page.
